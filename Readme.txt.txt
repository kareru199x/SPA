I created an SPA with ASP .NET MVC, Web API and AngularJS. 
For the data, i just used the SQL Server Database available within Visual Studio 19.

Implemented:
- Adding of new customer with form validation and duplicate checking
- List of Customer in table; display "No records found" when no data is found.
- View Customer data when email address is clicked.

Apologies, but I was not able to implement most of the functionalist as well as the UI updates / beautification.
